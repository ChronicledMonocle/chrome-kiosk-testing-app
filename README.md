# chrome-kiosk-testing-app
A project working to create a simple Google Sites/Forms front-end for testing/assessments at schools

To use, replace the URL in the window.html file with whatever starting URL you'd like and it should handle all links,
new window requests, and other stuff properly from there.  I recommend using a combination of Google Sites and Google Forms for
assessments, if you're a Apps for Education organization.  

This is a version 0.2 of this application and more features such as a TTS support, ChromeVox support, and much more are planned.
